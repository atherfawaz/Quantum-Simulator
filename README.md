# Simulating a quantum commputer using a classical computer


This notebook contains a quantum simulator built from scratch using basic libararies. The simulator performs the following functions:

*   Initialize a state
*   Run a program by calculating for each gate, a matrix operator and then applying it to the qubits
*   Perform multi-shot measurements of all qubits using weighted random technique
