        "Since qubits can exist in more states than just the traditional 0 and 1 of a bit, we can encode more information using them. In practice, it is possible to encode a classical bit using a qubit, but the converse is not true. You cannot encode a qubit of information in a classical transistor. Using bits, an n-component system can be encoded using n transistors; only 8 stored bits are required to encapsulate an 8-bit classical system. If the n-component system were instead to be quantum, 2ⁿ complex numbers would be required to encode it (Kopczyk, 2018). By extension, encoding an 8-qubit quantum computer requires 256 complex numbers. And to simulate 64 qubits one will need 2⁶⁴=18, 446, 744, 073, 709, 551, 616 complex numbers on a classical machine.\r\n",
